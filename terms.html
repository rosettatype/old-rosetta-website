      <p>This site has been produced and is maintained by Rosetta Type Foundry s.r.o. as further specified below (the &quot;Rosetta”). By accessing this website you agree to its terms and conditions.</p>
      <h3 id="payment-method">Payment method</h3>
      <p>Rosetta accepts credit/debit card payments via <a href="https://www.stripe.com">payment service provider Stripe</a>. Contact us via email (see below) if you wish to pay via bank transfer or if you wish to purchase our merchandise.</p>
      <h3 id="pay-with-card">Pay with card</h3>
      <p>In the webshop section of the website, select font(s) you wish to purchase licence for and proceed to payment. Fill in your purchase details and confirm the payment. You have to agree to our <a href="/licence">End-user licence agreement (EULA)</a> to proceed. When the payment is complete, you will receive an email with receipt/invoice and download link for the fonts within a day after your payment. The font files will be available for download for thirty (30) days after the purchase.</p>
      <p>If you somehow lose the fonts and need to download them again, contact us via email and we will send you a new download link.</p>
      <h3 id="custom-orders">Custom orders</h3>
      <p>If you wish to make a custom order (e.g. higher amount of computer licences, specific usage), please do not hesitate to contact us and we shall provide you with an invoice payable online. We will deliver the fonts via email after payment.</p>
      <h3 id="delivery">Delivery</h3>
      <p>The fonts are delivered as a zip-archive. Should you have any problem with their installation do not hesitate to contact us.</p>
      <p>Merchandise is shipped within seven (7) business days and delivered worldwide. Unless otherwise specified, all rates include shipping by regular mail.</p>
      <h3 id="value-added-tax-vat-policy">Value Added Tax (VAT) policy</h3>
      <p>Non-EU customers are not charged Czech VAT (21 %). EU customers are charged their local VAT unless they provide a valid VAT ID during the checkout process, in which case they are charged 0% VAT. Furthermore, with proof of business registration, we can cancel the VAT on ‘services’ for any European business entity upon enquiry. However, EU customers who were charged 0% VAT from us are required to declare and pay the associated value-added tax (the so-called ‘reverse charge’ procedure) in their country.</p>
      <p>This policy follows legislation defined in the Czech VAT law 235/2004, Article 9 of VAT Act No. 234/2004 Coll., and European Council Directive 2006/112/ES.</p>
      <h3 id="cancellation-and-refund-policy">Cancellation and refund policy</h3>
      <p>You have the right to cancel your order without giving any reason within 14 days provided the fonts have not been downloaded. If they have been downloaded no refund will be made.</p>
      <p>You can return merchandise within 14 days without giving any reason, in which case we will fully refund the cost of the merchandise. However, you will have to pay for the return shipping.</p>
      <p>Rosetta will replace the fonts in the event the fonts do not perform substantially in accordance with the documentation, provided that any such claim is submitted within thirty (30) days of purchase of this licence. Your sole recourse is replacement fonts; no refunds will be granted. To submit a claim you must return the fonts to Rosetta together with a copy of your sales receipt.</p>
      <h3 id="limited-warranty">Limited warranty</h3>
      <p>You expressly acknowledge and agree that use of the fonts is at your own risk. The fonts and related documentation are provided on “AS IS” basis, and except as noted herein are without warranty of any kind and Rosetta and its affiliated companies hereby expressly disclaim all warranties expressed and implied, including but not limited to the implied warranties of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose. Rosetta does not warrant that the operation of the fonts will be uninterrupted or error-free or that the fonts are without defects. The fonts are not fault-tolerant and are not intended, and were not designed or manufactured, for use in manufacturing navigation control equipment, or in any other circumstances where the use or failure of the fonts could lead to death, personal injury, property damage, or severe physical or environmental damage. Under no circumstances shall Rosetta be liable to you or any other party whether in contract or tort (including negligence) or otherwise for any special consequential or incidental damages including lost profits, savings, or business interruption, as a result of the use of the fonts even if notified in advance of such possibilities. Rosetta&#39;s liability to you shall in no event exceed refunding of the cost of the fonts or replacement of the fonts, at Rosetta&#39;s sole discretion.</p>
      <p>Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental, consequential, or special damages, or implied warranties. Only where applicable by law any implied warranty or condition created by law is only effective for a thirty (30) day warranty period. There are no warranties or conditions of any kind after the thirty (30) day warranty period. The exclusions noted above may not apply to you. Otherwise, and to the extent permissible by law, you agree that all implied warranties are not effective for more than thirty (30) days.</p>
      <h3 id="privacy-policy-and-data-security">Privacy policy and data security</h3>
      <p>Any customer information provided to Rosetta will be used only to process your order, provide support, or to send customers our promotional emails (newsletter). Under no circumstances will Rosetta sell or give away your information to any third party. With one exception, if you subscribed to our newsletter, we will share your name and email with our <a href="https://www.campaignmonitor.com">newsletter service provider</a>, but only for the purpose of distributing our newsletter. We do not store any financial or credit card information on our servers. This information is handled by our <a href="https://www.stripe.com">payment service provider</a> and safely encrypted.</p>
      <h3 id="data-collection-removal-and-modification">Data collection, removal, and modification</h3>
      <p>We try to collect as little data about you as possible and only collect accounting details, such as your name, email address, postal address, and VAT ID, during checkout. We also record name and email of the licence owners to keep track of their licence ownership and to inform them about updates to their purchased fonts. Please contact us via email if you wish the licence ownership data to be removed or modified or if you do not wish to receive information about the relevant updates. This service is independent of our newsletter. Note that we cannot remove data which forms the basis for our accounting.</p>
      <p>We collect your name and email address to send promotional emails (newsletter) 3–6 times a year only if you have requested them. If you wish to unsubscribe from the newsletter, you can do so by clicking a link at the bottom of the newsletter.</p>
