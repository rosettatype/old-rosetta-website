</a></p>

<p>Very early on in the development of <a href="/Skolar">Skolar</a> (originally conceived as a typeface for academic publishing), I knew it would need a sans serif counterpart in order to truly cover the needs of scholarly publications. It took several years to get to it and several more to finish. Along the way it has become the largest project Rosetta has tackled so far. It is important to note that it is a collaborative effort between Sláva Jevčinová (Slovakia) and myself. Also Rafael Saraiva (Brazil) helped a lot during his internship with Rosetta.</p>

<p><div class='image'><img src='../../../assets/2014-On-Skolar-Sans/academic-publishing.jpg' title='' width='610'><div class='imageDescription'><strong>Figure:</strong> Two of many scenarios where sans typefaces generally work better than serifs in academic publishing</div></div></p>

<h3>Skeletons and other costume ideas</h3>

<p>It is easy to say: “let’s design a sans to match the serif!”, but what does it actually mean? Let me try to answer that, at least theoretically. Clearly, one cannot simply chop off the serifs and hope that the outcome would be a decent sans. Sans serifs form a type genre of their own right! Type designers often use the idea of a shared skeleton to illustrate the translation from one to another. The skeleton is supposed to ensure that resulting typefaces are allied. In other words: the bones are the same but the muscles are different. This is a very compelling direction that we followed ourselves to a certain extent, but it has at least two issues.</p>

<p><div class='image'><img src='../../../assets/2014-On-Skolar-Sans/chop-off-technique.png' title='' width='610'><div class='imageDescription'><strong>Figure:</strong> Chop-off technique as employed in the sans making</div></div>
<div class='image'><img src='../../../assets/2014-On-Skolar-Sans/skeleton-technique.png' title='' width='610'><div class='imageDescription'><strong>Figure:</strong> Skeleton technique as employed in the sans making</div></div></p>

<p>Firstly, the skeleton does not give any indication about the style, contrast, or modulation (in fact it is abstracting exactly that). It makes sure the construction is similar, but how does one make sure the sans and the serif are coordinated stylistically despite belonging to two different genres? Secondly, it is the notion of harmonisation that is odd. What is the goal? Is it a sans mimicking the serif to ‘look as much as it as possible’ or perhaps something more?</p>

<h3>Making progress</h3>

<p>Our answer to the first issue lies in recognising the fact that serif and sans serif typefaces express themselves in different ways. Seriffed typefaces have terminals (actual serifs included) and/or a pronounced contrast between thick and thin strokes. Sans serifs, on the other hand, have limited options as they, obviously, do not have the actual serifs’ terminals and the contrast between thick and thin strokes is often reduced to a minimum. Simply put, less material to play with. Their power, however, lies in the sheer palette of styles and relationships between them. Thanks to their simplified letterforms, sans serifs can span from very thin to very bold, from narrow to wide. It is in this progression where the styling of conventional monolinear sans serifs has extensive possibilities. In the way the proportions and contrast mature from a showy thin style to a humble regular and unfold from there to the shouting heavy weights.</p>

<p><div class='image'><img src='../../../assets/2014-On-Skolar-Sans/italics-comparison_1.png' title='' width='610'><div class='imageDescription'><strong>Figure:</strong> The light and regular styles have different styling between the sans and the serif</div></div></p>

<p>In order to design a versatile sans, we had to tone down the styling. It simply would look too jolly and eccentric if we repeated everything that happens in Skolar’s seriffed contours. A bit of that was brought back in the way the weight progresses towards the bold styles. You can clearly see Skolar’s fingerprints there, yet they are much more subtle in the regular styles. The italics are perhaps even more explicit. The bold styles sport the broken contours of Skolar’s italics, while this feature does not come into play in the regular styles where it would have been distracting. Admittedly, this was not an easy task, and we had to redraw the typeface repeatedly to get it right. And just between us, it is not a good idea to change your mind when you are designing 72 fonts at once! The result is modest where appropriate and stylish where possible.</p>

<p><div class='image'><img src='../../../assets/2014-On-Skolar-Sans/italics-comparison_2.png' title='' width='610'><div class='imageDescription'><strong>Figure:</strong> The bold styles show the relationship between the sans and the serif clearly</div></div></p>

<h3>A companion with a mind of its own</h3>

<p>We did not want to design a lookalike sans for the serif, a clone. Instead of having a combo which <strong>looks</strong> great together we wanted a team that <strong>plays</strong> well together in order to solve design challenges. Therefore we aimed to design Skolar Sans as an independent companion to complement the serif in situations which are better served by a sans. Therefore whenever we had to decide if to follow Skolar’s path or have a well-working sans, we opted for the latter. The ultimate goal was to create a sans / serif type system that would work well in complex book typography and would be versatile enough for editorial and corporate environments. Three areas where Skolar is typically employed nowadays.</p>

<h3>72 fonts, was that really necessary?</h3>

<p>Perhaps we just got carried away, but let me elaborate a little. There are four different width variants: Compressed, Condensed, Normal, and Extended. The Normal variant was designed to fit the serif. However, it is noticeably narrower, which brings a change of rhythm that helps to distinguish between the sans and the serif in continuous text. But what if someone wants something a little wider than that? This is where the Extended variant derives its raison d’être. At first we designed it much wider, but it seemed pretty useless (I am still waiting for someone to show me why wide styles are actually useful). So the current Extended is just a tiny bit wider than Normal and will work best in logo design or on screen in small sizes. The Compressed and Condensed variants come in handy for narrow paragraphs, captions, and anywhere where the economic department has a stronger voice than the copywriters. But if no one finds them useful we promise to delete them.</p>

<h3>Arrows &amp;c.</h3>

<p>Here is a confession, we do love arrows, so the sans had to include them. And to Sláva it seemed, that the Compressed variant should have them compressed and the Extended should have them extended. That makes for a pretty wide selection of arrows. And they are easy to combine.</p>

<p>And needless to say, there are alternative forms, ligatures, small caps, multiple figure styles, fractions, superiors, inferiors, case-sensitive punctuation, and whatnot. Simply everything you might need to fine tune your text setting.</p>

<h3>Here they are</h3>

<p>To conclude and to leave our dear reader with a nice analogy, think of <a href="/SkolarSans">Skolar Sans</a> as a companion rather than a descendant. Not like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dick_Grayson">Dick Grayson</a> to Bruce Wayne but maybe John Watson to Sherlock Holmes. A versatile partner who can accommodate for an opinionated compadre, but does more than just follow his footsteps. Equally peculiar but nonetheless a gentleman. We hope you will use their services in the years to come.</p>

                  It has been ten years since we launched the first Rosetta website on 11 January 2011 at 11:11 CET and started making it our business selling fonts for multiple scripts of the world. This anniversary prompted a reminiscence of our past efforts, so here’s a personal look back at what those ten years brought to our corner of the industry.

                  For many years now, we have felt a gap in our library. The missing piece was a simple, no-frills sans serif that would appeal to contemporary modernist and post-modernist aesthetics. A straightforward, universal typeface easy to use for a wide range of design genres. We set out to develop this missing piece over three years ago in a pub in London’s Bloomsbury and today we release it to the world hoping it will serve you well. Below are a few notes about our thoughts and the process.
