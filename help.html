                  <p>We have introduced free Trial licence so you can try our fonts before investing in a proper licence. A couple of important things to remember:</p>

<ul>
<li>some characters have been removed from these fonts,</li>
<li>the fonts cannot be used for any project, commercial or non-commercial.</li>
</ul>

<p>To order, simply select the Trial licence in the left column during your checkout; then select the fonts you want to licence.</p>

<p>Trial fonts are not sufficient for proper designers’ work as it is intended only for testing or, for example, for creating mock-ups for the client to see before they commit to purchase your design. Once they do, you both need a licence.</p>

<p>Note: students can get a great discount on proper licence.</p>

                  <p>Every company seems to give the <strong>Pro</strong> suffix a different meaning. For us, it means typographic extras are included. This may be different for each script, but for Latin the fonts will be equipped with small caps, various figure sets, superiors, and fractions as a minimum standard.</p>

<p><strong>PE</strong> stands for Pan-European. Fonts with this suffix support Latin, Cyrillic, and Greek scripts.</p>

                  <p>Self-hosting means you can keep the webfonts on your own server. This has many benefits, there is no need for webfont providers, no monthly charges, no tracking code, no downtimes. On the other hand, it requires a bit of coding (CSS code is provided with the fonts) and reasonable measures have to be used to ensure that the webfonts cannot be extracted (prevention of direct links to the files, or hotlinking from other sites, and maintaining the cautionary note in the CSS). We provide an example HTML and CSS code for most fonts.</p>

<p>The fonts are provided in WOFF, and WOFF2 font formats which covers most of the contemporary browsers.</p>

<p>The self-hosting licence model is build on mutual trust. We do not enforce any tracking on our customers. In return we kindly ask them keep an eye on the total traffic and upgrade when appropriate.</p>

                  <p>It is possible for us to include it, however, it requires additional design work and post-production for which we are likely to charge. The pricing depends on the scope, but we often need to draw the character in multiple styles for the fonts to remain consistent.</p>

                  <p>When you “purchase a font” in our shop you are in fact licencing the font according to the terms of our End-user licence agreement (EULA) which clearly describes what you can and cannot be do with the fonts. The licence is the legally binding contract between the licence owner (you or your client) and Rosetta.</p>

                  <p>We have simplified as much as we could. Our licence is perpetual (one-off payment) and allows the use of the fonts on desktop (for up to 5 users) and on web (unlimited domains with collective total traffic below 500K pageviews/months).

<p>The default tier for the traffic is for up to 500K pageviews/monthly. If the monthly traffic exceeds the tier limit at any time (even for a short period), an upgrade to a higher tier is needed. Get in touch via email and we will arrange that.</p>

                  <p>To be precise, shopping for fonts is actually shopping for font licences. Here is how you do it in our e-shop:</p>

<p>Click the ‘Buy now’ button anywhere in the Font catalogue to order fonts for a particular typeface. You can only order fonts for a single typeface, but thanks to that the process is really simple.</p>

<p>First step. In the left column, select the licence type(s) which best cover your needs. In the right column, select the fonts you need. They are divided in groups based on language support which is clearly marked with the red buttons. When ready, click ‘Next step’ at the bottom of the page.</p>

<p>Second step. Fill in your details, specify the licence owner, review your order, and proceed with the payment.</p>

<p>You are done. The download link and receipt will be sent to you in an email.</p>

                  <p>In a nutshell a <strong>typeface</strong> is the design of a collection of <strong>characters</strong> that implement particular <strong>script(s)</strong>.

                  <p>A <strong>type family</strong> commonly includes styles in various <strong>weights</strong> and forms (italic or upright/roman). Sometimes all the variations do not fit in one family and that’s when super-families (or type systems) come in. The super-families include individual families which differ in <strong>width</strong> (e.g. Skolar Sans Compressed and Skolar Sans Extended) or <strong>intended size</strong> (so-called optical sizes, e.g. Neacademia Text and Neacademia Subhead).</p>

                  <p>A <strong>script</strong> is an organised set of signs, symbols and marks required to represent spoken language in written or printed form. A script is the visual representation while a <strong>writing system</strong> is the general system used for organization of these signs and their connection to the language. In short there are three basic categories of writing systems: alphabetic (e.g. the Latin script), syllabic (e.g. Indian scripts) and logographic (e.g. Chinese script). </p>

                  <p>The term <strong>complex script</strong> is used to describe scripts that require complex text layout features in order to ensure correct text shaping that allows the display of a given language adequately.

The shapes themselves might not be complex.</p>

<p>Indic and Arabic scripts are typical examples of complex scripts. </p>

                  <p><strong>Webfonts</strong> are <strong>fonts</strong> in formats intended for the web, e.g., WOFF, WOFF2, or EOT. They should be optimized for the web and reading on screen.</p>

                  <p>Hinting refers to special instructions in fonts which control the rasterisation process in low resolutions. In other words, better hinting means better performance of a font on the screen in small sizes. Hinting can be automated or manual. The latter usually means good appearance in text sizes (around conventional 10–16 pixels sizes) on screen, auto-hinting is sufficient for display sizes (ca. 18 pixels and above).</p>

<p>However, the best way to judge the performance of webfonts is to compare screenshots from various platforms.</p>

                  <p>The <strong>weight</strong> refers to different degrees of thickness of the strokes letterforms are made of or, in other words. The most commonly used weights are (from lightest to darkest): Thin, Extralight, Light, Regular, Medium, Semibold, Bold, Extrabold, Black. While the regular weight is traditionally the one used for continuous text, the extreme ends of the spectrum – such as Thin, Light, or Black – usually are more suitable for short texts, headlines, and for display purposes.</p>

                <div class="answer">
                  <p>In typeface design the term <strong>spacing</strong> describes the process of distributing space between characters in a font. By determining the space on each side of a character, the aim is to fit every character with all possible preceding or following characters (whether it be letters, punctuation etc.). The ultimate goal is to achieve a harmonious and balanced rhythm and an even colour/texture to ensure a pleasing and easily readable text. </p>

                <div class="answer">
                  <p>In contrast to <strong>spacing</strong>, <strong>kerning</strong> only deals with specific combinations of letters, not with general distribution of space/rhythm in a typeface.</p>

<p>The term <strong>kerning</strong> is often used instead of <strong>spacing</strong>. Such usage is wrong and should be punishable by milder forms of death!</p>

                <div class="answer">
                  <p>In close relation to <strong>spacing</strong> lies <strong>letter-spacing</strong> (or tracking), which is employed by the font user to manually adjust the defined spacing globally. If carefully applied, informed adjustments to the letter-spacing can prove to be useful in certain situations. Depending on the typeface, in display sizes, letters may appear a little too loosely arranged and in that case negative letter-spacing can be utilised to make for a more cohesive word shape. The same applies to small sizes where a moderate amount of positive letter-spacing can aid legibility and readability.</p>

<p>Excessive negative letter-spacing injures readers’ eyes and should be punishable by gently chopping both index fingers of the designer responsible.</p>

<p>Note: the concept of letter-spacing does not apply to scripts with connecting characters; here any alteration of letter-spacing will corrupt the design.</p>
